# OpenGL Rendering Project

This is a way for me to learn OpenGL. It is just a very simple renderer that will expand the more that I learned. It depends on GLFW, GLEW, and [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm). It uses OpenGL version 3.3.

## Building

Simply run `make` in the project directory.

## Controls

Left/Right arrow keys: rotate camera

Up/Down arrow keys: move camera forwards/backwards

Space: move up

## TODO

- Texture mapping
- Particle rendering
- Model file loading
- Mouse camera movement
